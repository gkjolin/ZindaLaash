# ZindaLaash


Just another zombie game. Made it for a friend's portfolio on game design. "Zinda Laash" is Hindi, and literally translates to "Living Corpses", because we ran out of creative zombie game names, although I did suggest "Mare hue chutiye" previously.


Assets are a mixture of stuff pulled in from the asset store and stuff made
by my roommate, Ningtam Wahengbam ([@W_Ningtam](https://twitter.com/W_Ningtam)).

The game idea is originally from Premjit Salam, who reached out to us to create
a prototype for said idea, for his portfolio on game design, which you can see
[HERE](https://salamprem49.wixsite.com/premjit).

The rules of the game is fairly simple, the tiles keep coming to the player
platform, and the player's goal is to shoot the platforms as well as the zombies
to keep themselves alive. The tiles touching the player's platform will damage
the player, as well as any zombie who makes it to the player platform. Some
tiles spawn as invincible, and the goal is to survive as long as possible.
